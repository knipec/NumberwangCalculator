NUMBERWANG CALCULATOR
________________________________________________________
To do:

- Wangernumb toggle button is correct when you reload
- crop Jeff picture

________________________________________________________
If time:
- Animate the "Wangernumb" and "Numberwang" icons
- Figure out MediaPlayer to allow user to toggle music

________________________________________________________
Completed:
- Wangernumb mode
	- "Let's play Wangernumb" at start of Wangernumb mode
	- After random number of keystrokes, it says "That's Wangernumb!" and switches you back to Numberwang
	- Has "hmmm"s after every keystroke

- Number buttons/decimal button pick a random number to display
	-Random number is random int, random float, random fractional number, or sqrt previous number

- Clear button increases text size and changes to random color until next button press

- Function buttons queue a pending function.
	- Pending functions are resolved when another function button, or the equal sign, is clicked
	- Pending functions act the same as pressing a number button

- Choose name at start: maybe let user enter their name, then randomly assigns them either Julie or Simon

- 2048 numberwang wacky numbers

Things we decided were impossible:
- When you close the app (???)
	- "<Name>, you've been Wangernumbed" + picture??? 
	  or
	  "<Name>, you are (today's) numberwang!"
