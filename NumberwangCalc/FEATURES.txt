	- "Let's play Wangernumb" at start of Wangernumb mode
	- After random number of keystrokes, it says "That's Wangernumb!" and switches you back to Numberwang
	- Has "hmmm"s after every keystroke

- When you close the app (???)
	- "<Name>, you've been Wangernumbed" + picture??? 
	  or
	  "<Name>, you are numberwang!"

- If time, figure out MediaPlayer to allow user to toggle music

- Number buttons/decimal button pick a random number to display
	-Random number is random int, random float, random fractional number, or sqrt previous number
- Clear button increases text size and changes to random color until next button press
- Function buttons queue a pending function.
	- Pending functions are resolved when another function button, or the equal sign, is clicked
	- Pending functions act the same as pressing a number button
